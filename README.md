# Pyping - An open-source TCP pinger
Pyping is a Python program that has been designed to replicate the functionality and user experience of Paping, a popular network connectivity tool created by Mike Lovell in 2011. Pyping offers the same intuitive interface and reliable performance as Paping, but with the added benefit of being compatible with all operating systems that support Python3. This means that users can enjoy the same high-quality experience regardless of their platform, and take advantage of the powerful features and capabilities of Python3 to enhance their networking capabilities. Pyping is the perfect solution for users who want the convenience and reliability of Paping, but with the added flexibility and compatibility of Python3.

## Benefits
One of the key advantages of using Pyping is its customizable output options. With Pyping, users have the ability to modify the appearance of the program's output in order to make it more visually appealing and easier to read. This can be especially useful when working with large amounts of data, as it allows users to highlight important information and make the output more organized and intuitive. Additionally, Pyping also offers the ability to modify the delay between each ping, giving users greater control over the speed and precision of their network diagnostics. This allows users to tailor the program's performance to their specific needs and requirements, making Pyping a highly versatile and efficient tool for network analysis and troubleshooting.
